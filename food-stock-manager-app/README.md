# Food Stock Manager App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Currently app expects to connect to backend at 'http://localhost:3000'. You can change this behavior by editing src/config.js file.
