# Provisioning Food Stock Manager

This is terraform code to provision infrastructure to run Food Stock Manager in AWS.

You will need to put a public ssh key in "./.ssh" folder for script to run. You can then use the key to connect to server instance with ssh. Ansible deployment scripts also rely on ssh to work.
